## Project Overview

Verify Bot is a Discord bot (or specify other platform if applicable) that automates user verification tasks, such as assigning roles, checking credentials, or managing access to community spaces. It’s built to be lightweight, extensible, and easy to integrate into various environments. 

The project is maintained by the [Gibwork](https://github.com/gibwork) team and is part of an ecosystem fostering open-source collaboration and Web3 innovation.

**Key Features**:
- Automated user verification workflows
- Customizable verification rules
- Integration with Discord APIs (or other platforms, if applicable)
- Scalable and modular codebase

We’re excited to have you contribute to making Verify Bot even better!

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up Verify Bot on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8.x or higher) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A Discord account and a bot token (see [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro))
- (Optional) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerized setups

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gibwork/verify-bot.git
   cd verify-bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open `.env` and add your Discord bot token and other required configurations:
     ```env
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
     # Add other variables as needed
     ```

4. **Run the Bot Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts the bot in development mode with hot-reloading (if applicable).

5. **Verify Setup**:
   - Invite the bot to a test Discord server.
   - Test basic commands (e.g., `!verify`) to ensure the bot responds.

For additional setup options (e.g., Docker), refer to the [docs](./docs) folder.
